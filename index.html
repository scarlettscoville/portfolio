      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>Hi there! My name is Scarlett.</h2>
      <p>I am married to my husband, Josh, and we have two wonderful little boys, Cole (age 12) and Bennett (age 9).  As a family, we enjoy camping, hiking, and kayaking!
        We also spend much of our time taking care of our many pets: five dogs, three cats, thousands of honeybees, fifteen chickens, three goldfish, three betta fish, a leopard gecko, a bearded dragon, a russian tortoise, and a crested gecko.
        My family lives in Macon, Georgia, about an hour and a half south of Atlanta.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have a Bachelor's degree in Telecommunications and Film from the University of Alabama, and a Master of Arts in Teaching Special Education from Georgia College and State University.  I am currently a student in the Coding Temple Bootcamp program.

      <h1>Why I Want to Become a Developer<h1>
      <p>My love and interest in coding came in the Fall of 2001 when I was enrolled in an Intro to Computer Science course at the University of Alabama.  I chose this course in leui of a foriegn language requirement, and did not expect anthing except an easy grade.  We learned 
        basic HTML and was required to build a website as a part of our final project in the course.  I think I might have considered pursuing a computer science degree, but I did not know 
        enough about the requirements, nor did I have the confidence to believe that it was something I could excel at.
        <br>
        <br>
        Fast-forward 21 years, and I decided that a major change was in order.  I have a unique family situation and needed a career that would allow me more flexibility to care for my family
        while contributing a significant income.  I had reflected many times over my current experience, and I noticed that in every job I've had my strengths were all linked to technology, my keen eye for details, and strenths in problem-solving.  I had also
        continued to code casually through apps and games, but not actively learn new languages or practices.  It occurred to me that software engineering/development may be something to look into,
        and upon further research I decided that it would be the career that would utilize my greatest strengths while also giving me the work-life balance required for my family.
